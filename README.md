This project depends on ai image recongation in the getson orin. In this case, I used google net to identify the imgae.
first you will need to import neccary functions for this.
next you need to parser the file name and get google net for the ai model. you can use different model, just change the name on line 11 and 16
Next step is to get the image 
Next we will need to let the google net classify the image and give us the index number. whith this index nunber we can get the name of this animal. 
now we want to know whether this snake is venomous or not.
If the user didn't give us a picture of snake, print this animal is so cute.
