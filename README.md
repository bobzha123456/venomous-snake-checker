This project depends on ai image recongation in the getson orin. In this case, I used google net to identify the imgae.

First, you will need to import the necessary functions for this.

Next, you need to parse the file name and retrieve the Google Net model for the AI. You can use a different model, change the name on lines 11 and 16

The next step is to get the image. 

Next, we will need to let Ai classify the image and provide us with the index number. With this index number, we can get the name of this animal. 

Now we want to know whether this snake is venomous or not.

If the user didn't give us a picture of a snake, print this animal is so cute.
